{"source": "{\"abstract\": \"Chemoresistance is a major cause of treatment failure and poor outcome in neuroblastoma. In this study, we investigated the expression and function of dual-specificity phosphatase 26 (DUSP26), also known as mitogen-activated protein kinase phophatase-8, in human neuroblastoma. We found that DUSP26 was expressed in a majority of neuroblastoma cell lines and tissue specimens. Importantly, we found that DUSP26 promotes the resistance of human neuroblastoma to doxorubicin-induced apoptosis by acting as a p53 phosphatase to downregulate p53 tumor suppressor function in neuroblastoma cells. Inhibiting DUSP26 expression in the IMR-32 neuroblastoma cell line enhanced doxorubicin-induced p53 phosphorylation at Ser20 and Ser37, p21, Puma, Bax expression as well as apoptosis. In contrast, DUSP26 overexpression in the SK-N-SH cell line inhibited doxorubicin-induced p53 phosphorylation at Ser20 and Ser37, p21, Puma, Bax expression and apoptosis. Using in vitro and in vivo assays, we found that DUSP26 binds to p53 and dephosphorylates p53 at Ser20 and Ser37. In this report, we show that DUSP26 functions as a p53 phosphatase, which suppresses downstream p53 activity in response to genotoxic stress.

We found that Q9BV47 was expressed in a majority of neuroblastoma cell lines and tissue specimens. Importantly, we found that Q9BV47 promotes the resistance of human neuroblastoma to doxorubicin-induced apoptosis by acting as a P04637 phosphatase to downregulate P04637 tumor suppressor function in neuroblastoma cells.

In contrast, Q9BV47 overexpression in the SK-N-SH cell line inhibited doxorubicin-induced P04637 phosphorylation at Ser20 and Ser37, 644914, Q96PG8, Q07812 expression and apoptosis.

{"source": "{\"abstract\": \"TAK1 (transforming growth factor beta-activated kinase 1) is a serine/threonine kinase that is a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase and an essential intracellular signaling component in inflammatory signaling pathways. Upon stimulation of cells with inflammatory cytokines, TAK1 binds proteins that stimulate autophosphorylation within its activation loop and is thereby catalytically activated. This activation is transient; it peaks within a couple of minutes and is subsequently down-regulated rapidly to basal levels. The mechanism of down-regulation of TAK1 has not yet been elucidated. In this study, we found that toxin inhibition of type 2A protein phosphatases greatly enhances interleukin 1 (IL-1)-dependent phosphorylation of Thr-187 in the TAK1 activation loop as well as the catalytic activity of TAK1. From proteomic analysis of TAK1-binding proteins, we identified protein phosphatase 6 (PP6), a type-2A phosphatase, and demonstrated that PP6 associated with and inactivated TAK1 by dephosphorylation of Thr-187. Ectopic and endogenous PP6 co-precipitated with TAK1, and expression of PP6 reduced IL-1 activation of TAK1 but did not affect osmotic activation of MLK3, another MAPKKK. Reduction of PP6 expression by small interfering RNA enhances IL-1-induced phosphorylation of Thr-187 in TAK1. Enhancement occurred without change in levels of PP2A showing specificity for PP6.
